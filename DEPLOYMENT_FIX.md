# BanterBox Discord Fix - Deployment Guide

## Current WebSocket Error Issue
You're seeing `WebSocket connection to 'wss://banterbox-discord-bot.onrender.com/ws' failed` because:
- ✅ **Local Build**: Working perfectly with all fixes
- ❌ **Render Build**: Failing with syntax error on line 62
- ❌ **WebSocket**: Can't connect because server isn't running on Render

## The Problem
Render is building from your GitHub repository which has old code with:
```
server/discord.ts:62:5: ERROR: Expected identifier but found ")"
```

## The Solution
The fixed code is ready locally. You need to push it to GitHub and redeploy.

### Step 1: Push Fixed Code to GitHub
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Discord voice connection tracking and build syntax error"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your BanterBox service
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"**
4. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Watch the build logs - should show "✅ Server built successfully"

### Step 3: Verify Fix
Once deployed successfully:
- WebSocket errors will stop
- Check Render logs for these debug messages:
  - "Discord bot ready! Logged in as BanterBox#XXXX"
  - "Bot found in voice channel..." (if bot was in channel)
  - "Voice connections: X guilds: [...]"

## What Was Fixed
1. **Syntax Error**: Removed invisible characters causing build failure at line 62
2. **Voice Tracking**: Added enhanced logging to diagnose connection issues
3. **WebSocket**: Will connect successfully once deployment succeeds

## Files Changed
- `server/discord.ts` - Cleaned syntax, added debug logging
- `replit.md` - Documented all fixes

## After Successful Deployment
You'll see:
- Clean build logs on Render
- WebSocket connecting without errors
- Enhanced Discord debug messages
- Voice connection state properly tracked

## Package Available
`banterbox-discord-debug-fixed.tar.gz` contains all fixed files

## Need Help?
If deployment still fails after pushing to GitHub, check:
1. GitHub shows your latest commit with the fixes
2. Render is deploying from the correct branch (main)
3. Build logs on Render for any new errors
