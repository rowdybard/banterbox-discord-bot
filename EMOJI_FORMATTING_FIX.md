# 🔧 Emoji/Formatting Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The bot was responding with literal text like "asterisk" instead of actual formatting or emojis. For example:
- ❌ **Before**: "asterisk" wow "asterisk" 
- ✅ **After**: "wow" (natural text)

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The AI was trying to use Discord markdown formatting (like `*bold*` or `*italic*`) but the system prompt didn't specify how to handle formatting, causing the AI to output literal text instead of proper formatting.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Updated System Prompt**
Added explicit instructions to use plain text only:

```typescript
// Before:
content: "Generate entertaining responses for live streamers. Keep responses engaging, fun, and under 25 words. Match the personality and energy requested."

// After:
content: "Generate entertaining responses for live streamers. Keep responses engaging, fun, and under 25 words. Match the personality and energy requested. Use plain text only - no markdown formatting, asterisks, or special characters. Write naturally as if speaking."
```

### **2. Updated Personality Prompts**
Added "Use plain text only" to all personality types:

```typescript
const personalityPrompts = {
  witty: "Be witty and clever with natural wordplay and humor. Keep responses under 20 words. Use plain text only.",
  friendly: "Be warm and encouraging with positive energy. Respond naturally and supportively. Use plain text only.",
  sarcastic: "Be playfully sarcastic but fun, not mean. Use clever sarcasm and natural comebacks. Use plain text only.",
  hype: "BE HIGH-ENERGY! Use caps and exclamation points! GET EVERYONE PUMPED UP! Use plain text only.",
  chill: "Stay relaxed and laid-back. Keep responses natural, zen, and easygoing. Use plain text only.",
  roast: "Be playfully roasting and teasing. Use clever burns that are funny, not hurtful. Use plain text only."
};
```

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

- ✅ **No more "asterisk" text** - AI will use natural language
- ✅ **Proper emoji usage** - AI can use actual emojis when appropriate
- ✅ **Natural responses** - Responses sound more conversational
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** - All responses use plain text

## 🚀 **After Deployment**

The bot will now:
- Use natural language without markdown artifacts
- Include emojis properly when appropriate
- Sound more conversational and less robotic
- Maintain personality while using clean text

## 📝 **Example Improvements**

| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| "asterisk" wow "asterisk" | "Wow!" |
| "asterisk" thanks "asterisk" | "Thanks! 😊" |
