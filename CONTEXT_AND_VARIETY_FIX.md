# üîß Context, Pronunciation & Variety Fixes

## ‚ùå **Problems Identified**

1. **Context not working** - Bot wasn't remembering previous conversations
2. **Pronunciation issues** - Words like "Altima" were being mispronounced
3. **Repetitive responses** - Bot kept using the same 1-liners over and over

## üîç **Root Causes**

### **Context Issues:**
- Context retention was too short (1-20 hours)
- Context retrieval was limited (only 5 recent interactions)
- Context formatting wasn't clear enough for AI to understand
- Context instructions were too vague

### **Pronunciation Issues:**
- No pronunciation hints for car models and other specific words
- AI was guessing pronunciations for brand names

### **Repetitive Responses:**
- Temperature was too low (0.9) - not enough creativity
- No penalties for repetition
- Personality prompts didn't emphasize variety
- System prompt didn't encourage uniqueness

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Context System (`server/contextService.ts`)**

**Improved Context Retention:**
```typescript
// Increased retention time
const hoursToRetain = Math.max(2, importance * 3); // 2-30 hours (was 1-20)

// Increased context retrieval
const recentContext = await storage.getRecentContext(userId, guildId, 8); // was 5
const similarContext = await storage.getContextByType(userId, currentEventType, guildId, 5); // was 3
```

**Better Context Formatting:**
```typescript
// Clearer conversation history format
contextString += "Recent conversation history:\n";
recentContext.reverse().forEach((ctx, index) => {
  if (ctx.originalMessage) {
    contextString += `${index + 1}. User said: "${ctx.originalMessage}"\n`;
  }
  if (ctx.banterResponse) {
    contextString += `   You responded: "${ctx.banterResponse}"\n`;
  }
});
```

**Enhanced Context Instructions:**
```typescript
contextString += "IMPORTANT: Use this conversation history to provide contextually aware responses. Remember what was discussed and refer back to it naturally. Avoid repeating the same responses - be creative and varied while staying connected to the conversation. If someone mentioned something specific (like a car model, hobby, etc.), reference it naturally in your response.";
```

### **2. Pronunciation Hints (`server/routes.ts`)**

**Added pronunciation guidance for common car models:**
```typescript
// Add pronunciation hints for common words that might be mispronounced
let enhancedPrompt = prompt;
if (originalMessage) {
  const lowerMessage = originalMessage.toLowerCase();
  if (lowerMessage.includes('altima')) {
    enhancedPrompt += "\n\nPronunciation note: 'Altima' is pronounced 'all-TEE-mah' (like 'all' + 'team' + 'ah').";
  }
  if (lowerMessage.includes('camry')) {
    enhancedPrompt += "\n\nPronunciation note: 'Camry' is pronounced 'CAM-ree' (like 'camera' without the 'a').";
  }
  // ... more car models
}
```

### **3. Enhanced AI Creativity (`server/routes.ts`)**

**Improved Personality Prompts:**
```typescript
const personalityPrompts = {
  witty: "Be witty and clever with natural wordplay and humor. Keep responses under 25 words. Use plain text only. Be creative and avoid repetition.",
  friendly: "Be warm and encouraging with positive energy. Respond naturally and supportively. Use plain text only. Show genuine interest and vary your responses.",
  // ... all personalities now emphasize variety
};
```

**Enhanced AI Parameters:**
```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Generate entertaining responses for live streamers. Keep responses engaging, fun, and under 25 words. Match the personality and energy requested. Use plain text only - no markdown formatting, asterisks, or special characters. Write naturally as if speaking. Be creative and varied - avoid repeating the same phrases or responses. Each response should feel fresh and unique."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: enhancedPrompt
    }
  ],
  max_tokens: 120, // Increased from 100
  temperature: 1.1, // Increased from 0.9 for more creativity
  presence_penalty: 0.3, // Penalize repetition
  frequency_penalty: 0.5, // Penalize frequent words
});
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push these changes**
2. **Deploy to Render**
3. **Test the improvements**

## üìã **What These Fixes Address**

### **‚úÖ Context System:**
- Bot will now remember conversations for 2-30 hours (was 1-20)
- Retrieves 8 recent interactions (was 5) for better memory
- Clearer conversation history format for AI understanding
- Better instructions for contextual responses
- Bot will reference previous conversations naturally

### **‚úÖ Pronunciation:**
- "Altima" will be pronounced "all-TEE-mah" instead of weird variations
- "Camry" will be "CAM-ree" instead of "cam-REE"
- "Civic" will be "SIV-ik" instead of "see-VICK"
- And many more car models covered

### **‚úÖ Response Variety:**
- Higher temperature (1.1) for more creative responses
- Presence penalty (0.3) to avoid repeating phrases
- Frequency penalty (0.5) to avoid overusing words
- Enhanced system prompt emphasizing uniqueness
- Personality prompts now emphasize variety
- Increased max tokens (120) for more detailed responses

## üîç **Expected Results**

**Before:**
- User: "I drive a Nissan Altima"
- Bot: "That's cool!" (forgets immediately)
- User: "What car do I drive?"
- Bot: "I don't know" (no context)

**After:**
- User: "I drive a Nissan Altima"
- Bot: "Nice choice! The all-TEE-mah is a solid sedan."
- User: "What car do I drive?"
- Bot: "You drive a Nissan Altima! How's the all-TEE-mah treating you?" ‚úÖ

**Before:**
- Bot: "Thanks for the interaction!" (repeated constantly)

**After:**
- Bot: Various creative responses that feel fresh and unique ‚úÖ

## üéØ **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Test context memory with car conversations
- [ ] Verify pronunciation of "Altima" and other car models
- [ ] Check that responses feel varied and not repetitive
- [ ] Confirm bot remembers previous conversations
- [ ] Test different personalities for variety
