## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client is built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** for optimized builds. It uses **Wouter** for lightweight routing, **TanStack Query** for server state management, **Radix UI** with **shadcn/ui** for UI components, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Framer Motion** for animations. The structure is modular with clear separation between UI, feature, and page components.

### Backend Architecture
The server is implemented using **Express.js** with TypeScript, following RESTful API principles. It includes an API layer for CRUD operations, WebSocket integration for real-time communication, and business logic for OpenAI GPT integration for banter generation and audio processing.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL** as the primary database. The schema supports users, banter items (with event data, content, and audio URLs), user settings, and daily statistics for usage analytics.

### Real-time Communication
A **WebSocket** implementation provides persistent connections between the dashboard and overlay for instant banter delivery, including event broadcasting and automatic reconnection logic.

### Authentication and Authorization
The system includes user authentication using Replit Auth with OpenID Connect, user account management, and Pro access functionality. User ownership verification is implemented for banter access control to ensure multi-user isolation.

### Voice and Audio Processing
AI integration utilizes **OpenAI GPT models** for context-aware banter generation. It supports configurable voice providers and includes robust audio URL management and client-side playback with queue management. All personality prompts are enhanced with explicit ElevenLabs emotional expression instructions to ensure AI compliance with expression requirements.

### Overlay System
The customizable stream overlay is designed for optimal OBS Browser Source integration. It is completely invisible when no banter is active, features a compact, fixed-position banter box, and displays real-time banter synchronized with audio playback. Streamers position and resize the overlay directly within OBS.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design focuses on accessibility and customizability, leveraging Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent theme. User experience features include an onboarding tutorial system, a usage dashboard with daily limits and upgrade prompts, and a comprehensive Pro upgrade flow. Users can also select from 5 predefined personality templates for banter generation or define their own custom AI behavior.
